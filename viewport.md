## Viewport

<p>In the mobile world, the physical size of the screen is limited by the physical size of the typical human hand.</p>
<p>This viewport declaration was introduced by Apple for the iPhone and, although not properly standardized yet, has now been
adopted by most other mobile browser vendors.</p>
